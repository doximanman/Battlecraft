# Battlecraft
This game is about surviving and killing monsters!<br>
Can you survive and find all the chests? Can you get the LEGENDARY GOLD SWORD?<br>
Note: Crafting recipes are not provided. You need to find them out yourself! Here's a helper:<br>
- a knife is a stick and an iron
- an axe is a stick and 2 iron
- a crafting bench is a knife, an axe, and 2 wood
- a furnace is 8 iron and one wood<br>

Good luck!<br>

In the server folder you can find, well, the server, which is coded in Python 3. It defines a websocket general API request-response communication style, allowing the server to be used with theoretically any client that can handle the API!<br>
